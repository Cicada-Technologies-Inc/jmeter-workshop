# Git Test

This demo is a variation of the hello_world demo. Its aim is to display, through git history, a git merge process.

First, a copy of the hello_world demo is added to the repo as git_test.
Then a new feature branch is created and the project is extended in this branch.
Then the git_test project from the main branch is extended.
Finally the feature branch is merged into the main branch.
