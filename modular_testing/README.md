# Modular Testing

This demo showcases a modular project structure with reusable `Test Fragments` at the top level and tests grouped through simple controllers for fast enabling and disabling of test cases.

Each `Test Fragment` is defined at the root level and used in a `Thread Group` through the `Module Controller`.
